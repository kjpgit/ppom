empty -> Any() 

Equivalent for enumerate()

No generic OrderedDictionary :(

No generic inplace sort +  key


## VS Code

Multiple projects - manual change in omnisharp (intellisense)

No built in "run tests" cmd, have to write json or just run from terminal

Turn off codelens ("N References" above every line of code)
